# Specifications

This responsive web app has been built with using [Python 3.7](https://docs.python.org/3.7/) and the Python microframework [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and a [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) approach.

It uses [pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/) to create and manage the python virtual environment.

It uses AJAX for interaction beetween the index page and the web server.

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is used to create the responsive interface.

[NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/) is used to help parsing the questions that the users may ask to GrandPy.

[Google Maps Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start) is used to find the location of the searched place.

[Google Maps Javascript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial) is used to display the map with a marker on the location of the searched place.

[Wikipedia python Api](https://pypi.org/project/wikipedia/) is used to get some information about the street where the searched place is located.
